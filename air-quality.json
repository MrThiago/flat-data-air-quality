This path is often associated with import of particulate pollution. A gradual rise in particulate levels on Saturday as the wind direction turns easterly indicates we are likely to see a similar and persistent import of particulate on Sunday. The import, combined with local emissions will likely lead to &#39;Moderate&#39; levels of PM10 and PM2.5 particulate pollution on Sunday, particularly at roadside locations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The prolonged sunshine may also mean a rise in ozone pollution, through the day particularly in outer-London.
