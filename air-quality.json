With this, a rise in particulate levels is expected as imported pollution combines with our own emissions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, particulate levels in Paris are not unusually elevated at present and the import into London is therefore expected to be quite modest. The relatively high altitude path of the air should also limit its potential to accumulate pollution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Air pollution is expected to remain &#39;Low&#39; throughout the forecast period for the following pollutants:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ozone&lt;br/&gt;PM10 Particulates&lt;br/&gt;PM2.5 Particulates&lt;br/&gt;Sulphur Dioxide&lt;br/&gt;Nitrogen Dioxide&lt;br/&gt;"},{"$id":"3","$type":"Tfl.Api.Presentation.Entities.CurrentForecast, Tfl.Api.Presentation.Entities","forecastType":"Future","forecastID":"35365","publishedDate":"2022-02-03T09:50:25Z","fromDate":"2022-04-03T00:00:00Z","toDate":"2022-04-03T23:59:00Z","forecastBand":"Low","forecastSummary":"Low air pollution forecast valid from Friday 4 March to end of Friday 4 March GMT","nO2Band":"Low","o3Band":"Low","pM10Band":"Low","pM25Band":"Low","sO2Band":"Low","forecastText":"A change in wind direction on Friday will bring a feed of relatively &#39;clean&#39; air into London, initially from western France and then the Atlantic.
