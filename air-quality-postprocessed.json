Most parts staying dry, although the odd shower cannot be completely ruled out. Light winds, but feeling rather cool. The fresh breeze will disperse local emissions and little imported pollution. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Air pollution is expected to remain &#39;Low&#39; throughout the forecast period for the following pollutants:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nitrogen Dioxide&lt;br/&gt;Ozone&lt;br/&gt;Sulphur Dioxide &lt;br/&gt;PM10 Particulates&lt;br/&gt;PM2.5 Particulates",
