From late afternoon it&#39;s expected to give way to an easterly airflow which will have passed at low altitude over urban and industrial areas on the continent. This later air-feed may contain a higher particulate load and as a result we may reach &#39;Moderate&#39; particulates by evening.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Air pollution is expected to remain &#39;Low&#39; throughout the forecast period for the following pollutants:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nitrogen Dioxide&lt;br/&gt;Ozone&lt;br/&gt;Sulphur Dioxide &lt;br/&gt;",
