        "description": "Weather fronts bringing cold air from the Arctic Circle will affect Greater London during Thursday. Any early fog patches will clear, with sunny periods following for most. Most parts staying dry, although the odd shower cannot be completely ruled out, feeling rather cool.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Good dispersion of local emissions is expected during daylight hours on a fresh northerly breeze. However, the wind will fall lighter during the evening and this will coincide with the start of Diwali celebration firework displays. If the celebrations are widespread, PM10 and PM2.5 particulate concentrations will increase, especially in suburban areas. This might result in particulate levels reaching the &#39;Moderate&#39; banding in some locations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Air pollution is expected to remain &#39;Low&#39; throughout the forecast period for the following pollutants:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nitrogen Dioxide&lt;br/&gt;Ozone&lt;br/&gt;Sulphur Dioxide &lt;br/&gt;",
