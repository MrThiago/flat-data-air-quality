Also a later air feed via the near continent may introduce some particulate pollution and levels may begin to build later on Friday evening.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Overall air pollution is expected to remain &#39;Low&#39; throughout the forecast period for the following pollutants:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nitrogen Dioxide&lt;br/&gt;Ozone&lt;br/&gt;PM10 Particulates&lt;br/&gt;PM2.5 Particulates&lt;br/&gt;Sulphur Dioxide",
