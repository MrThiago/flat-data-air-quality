        "description": "A high pressure system centred over southern England will give settled weather conditions in Greater London throughout Thursday. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With very light winds, levels of PM10 and PM2.5 Particulates will rise in near-road environments as local emissions are poorly dispersed. Although &#39;Moderate&#39; Particulates may occur by a few very heavily congested roadside locations, a continuing light feed of &#39;clean&#39; Atlantic air and relatively mild temperatures should ensure that a widespread episode does not develop.&lt;br/&gt;Colder day with stronger winds on Friday. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Air pollution is largely expected to remain &#39;Low&#39; throughout the forecast period for the following pollutants:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nitrogen Dioxide&lt;br/&gt;Ozone&lt;br/&gt;Sulphur Dioxide &lt;br/&gt;PM10 Particulates&lt;br/&gt;PM2.5 Particulates",
