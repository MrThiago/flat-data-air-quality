        "description": "The rest of the weekend is set to be cloudy with a possibility of rain on Sunday, cold but sunshine on Monday.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Incoming air, while initially from Europe, is expected to become more westerly as influenced by an area of high pressure moving eastwards across the continent. Therefore bringing little by way of pollution import.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With winds picking up over the weekend, dispersion of locally emitted pollution should improve when compared with recent days. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Overall, air pollution is expected to remain &#39;Low&#39; throughout the forecast period for the following pollutants:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ozone&lt;br/&gt;Sulphur Dioxide&lt;br/&gt;Nitrogen Dioxide&lt;br/&gt;PM10 Particulates&lt;br/&gt;PM2.5 Particulates&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;",
