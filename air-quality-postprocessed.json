There&#39;s likely to be an additional particulate contribution from fireworks to celebrate Diwali. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With little wind to aid dispersion, particulate concentrations are expected to widely reach the &#39;Moderate&#39; banding across Greater London. Close to larger Guy Fawkes Night and Diwali events, there is the potential for particulate concentrations to reach the &#39;High&#39; banding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Air pollution is expected to remain &#39;Low&#39; throughout the forecast period for the following pollutants:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nitrogen Dioxide&lt;br/&gt;Ozone&lt;br/&gt;Sulphur Dioxide &lt;br/&gt;",
