With the breeze continuing into the evening, there should be good dispersion of particulates emitted from Guy Fawkes firework displays and bonfires.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Air pollution is expected to remain &#39;Low&#39; throughout the forecast period for the following pollutants:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nitrogen Dioxide&lt;br/&gt;Ozone&lt;br/&gt;Sulphur Dioxide &lt;br/&gt;PM10 Particulates&lt;br/&gt;PM2.5 Particulates&lt;br/&gt;",
