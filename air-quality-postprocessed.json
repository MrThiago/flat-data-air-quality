This will result in an increase in particulate concentrations in Greater London as imported pollution mixes with local emissions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, a gradual change in the path of the incoming air is then forecast later in the day and this will reduce levels of imported particulates. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Air pollution is expected to remain &#39;Low&#39; throughout the forecast period for the following pollutants:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nitrogen Dioxide&lt;br/&gt;Ozone&lt;br/&gt;Sulphur Dioxide &lt;br/&gt;PM10 Particulates&lt;br/&gt;PM2.5 Particulates&lt;br/&gt;",
